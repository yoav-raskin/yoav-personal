## 1. Provinces of Argentina
<p><img style="float: left;margin:5px 20px 5px 1px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Buenos_Aires_Puerto_Madero_19.jpg/1200px-Buenos_Aires_Puerto_Madero_19.jpg" title="Photo by Andrzej Otrębski CC BY-SA 4.0"></p>
<p>With almost 40 million inhabitants and a diverse geography that encompasses the Andes mountains, glacial lakes, and the Pampas grasslands, Argentina is the second largest country (by area) and has one of the largest economies in South America. It is politically organized as a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city, Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>We will analyze ten economic and social indicators collected for each province. Because these indicators are highly correlated, we will use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce redundancies and highlight patterns that are not apparent in the raw data. After visualizing the patterns, we will use k-means clustering to partition the provinces into groups with similar development levels. </p>
<p>These results can be used to plan public policy by helping allocate resources to develop infrastructure, education, and welfare programs.</p>


```{r}
# Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
# Read in the dataset
argentina <- read_csv("C:/Users/yoavr/Google Drive/R/PROJECT PLANNING PUBLIC POLICY IN ARGENTINA/argentina.csv")

# Inspect the first rows of the dataset
nrow(argentina)
head(argentina)
```



## 2. Most populous, richest provinces
<p>Argentina ranks third in South America in total population, but the population is unevenly distributed throughout the country. Sixty percent of the population resides in the Pampa region (Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Córdoba) which only encompasses about 20% of the land area.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">GDP</a> is a measure of the size of a province's economy. To measure how rich or poor the inhabitants are, economists use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita"><em>per capita GDP</em></a>, which is GDP divided by the province's population.</p>


```{r}
# Add gdp_per_capita column to argentina
argentina <- argentina %>% 
  mutate(gdp_per_cap = gdp / pop) 

# Find the four richest provinces
( rich_provinces  <- argentina %>% 
arrange(gdp_per_cap) %>% 
    select(province, gdp_per_cap) %>% 
    top_n(4))
# Find the provinces with populations over 1 million
( bigger_pops <- argentina %>%
    arrange(desc(pop)) %>%
    select(province, pop) %>% 
    filter(pop > 1000000))
  
```


## 3. 
```{r}
# Select numeric columns and cast to matrix
argentina_matrix  <- argentina  %>% 
  select_if(is_numeric) %>%  
  as.matrix()

# Print the first lines of the result
head(argentina_matrix)

```


## 4. Reducing dimensions
<p>PCA finds a lower dimensional representation of the data that keeps the maximum amount of variance. It's great for analyzing multivariate datasets, like this one, with multiple numerical columns that are highly correlated. Typically, the first few components preserve most of the information in the raw data, allowing us, to go from eleven dimensions (eleven original variables) down to two dimensions (two variables that are summaries of the original eleven).</p>
<p>To run PCA, we need to make sure all the variables are on similar scales. Otherwise, variables with large variance will be overrepresented. In <code>PCA()</code> setting <code>scale.unit = TRUE</code> ensures that variables are scaled to unit variance before crunching the numbers.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore the output! </p>


```{r}
# Load FactoMineR
library(FactoMineR)
# Apply PCA and print results
( argentina_pca  <- PCA(argentina_matrix, scale.unit = TRUE) )
```


## 5. PCA: Variables & Components
<p>Now that we have the principal components, we can see how the original variables are correlated among themselves and how the original variables are correlated with the principal components. We will build a plot using the <code>factoextra</code> package to help us understand these relationships. A correlation circle plot (also known as a variable correlation plot) shows the relationship among all variables as they are plotted on the first two principal components (Dimension 1 and Dimension 2).</p>
<p>To understand the plot, note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positively correlated variables have similar vectors.</li>
<li>The vectors of negatively correlated variables are on opposite sides of the plot origin (opposite quadrants).</li>
<li>Each axis represents a principal component. Vectors pointing in the direction of the component are correlated with that component.</li>
<li>The percentage of the original variance explained by each component (dimension) is given in parentheses in the axes labels.</li>
</ul>


```{r}
# Load factoextra
library(factoextra)
# Set the size of plots in this notebook
options(repr.plot.width=7, repr.plot.height=5)

# Plot the original variables and the first 2 components and print the plot object.
( pca_var_plot <- fviz_pca_var(argentina_pca) )

# Sum the variance preserved by the first two components. Print the result.
( variance_first_two_pca <- argentina_pca$eig[1, 2] + argentina_pca$eig[2, 2] )
```


## 6. Plotting the components
<p>With the first two principal components representing almost 65% of the variance, most of the information we are interested in is summarized in these two components. From the variable correlation plot, we can see that population and GDP are highly correlated; illiteracy, poverty, no healthcare, school dropout, and deficient infrastructure are correlated; and GDP per capita and movie theaters per capita are correlated.</p>
<p>But how do these correlations map to the provinces? To dive into that question, let's plot the individual principal components for each province and look for clusters.</p>


```{r}
# Visualize Dim2 vs. Dim1
fviz_pca_ind(argentina_pca, title = "Provinces - PCA")
```


## 7. Cluster using K means
<p>It looks like one province stands out and the rest follow the gradient along the second dimension. Are there clusters we are not detecting? Let's use K-means clustering to see if there are patterns we are not detecting.</p>


```{r}
# Set seed to 1234 for reproducibility
set.seed(1234)
# Create an intermediate data frame with pca_1 and pca_2
argentina_comps <- tibble(pca_1 = argentina_pca$ind$coord[ ,1],  
                          pca_2 = argentina_pca$ind$coord[ ,2])

# Cluster the observations using the first 2 components and print its contents
( argentina_km <- kmeans(argentina_comps,
                         centers = 4, iter.max = 50, nstart = 20) )
```



# 8. Components with colors
<p>Now that we have cluster assignments for each province, we will plot the provinces according to their principal components coordinates, colored by the cluster.</p>


```{r}
# Convert assigned clusters to factor
clusters_as_factor <- factor(argentina_km$cluster)
# Plot individulas colored by cluster
fviz_pca_ind(argentina_pca, 
             title = "Clustered Provinces - PCA", 
             habillage = clusters_as_factor) 
```



## 9. Buenos Aires, in a league of its own
<p>A few things to note from the scatter plot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster 1 includes only Buenos Aires and has a large positive value in Dimension 2 with an intermediate negative value in Dimension 1.</li>
<li>Cluster 2 has the greatest negative values in Dimension 1.</li>
<li>Cluster 3 has the greatest positive values in Dimension 1.</li>
<li>Cluster 4 has small absolute values in Dimension 1.</li>
<li>Clusters 2, 3, and 4, all have small absolute values in Dimension 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will focus on exploring clusters 1, 2, and 3 in terms of the original variables in the next few tasks.</p>
<p>As we noted earlier, Buenos Aires is in a league of its own, with the largest positive value in Dimension 2 by far. The figure below is a biplot, a combination of the individuals plot from Task 6 and the circle plot from Task 5.</p>
<p><img width="700px" height="700px" src="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_638/img/biplot.png"></p>
<p>Since the vectors corresponding to <code>gdp</code> and <code>pop</code> are in the same direction as Dimension 2, Buenos Aires has high GDP and high population. Let's visualize this pattern with a plot of <code>gdp</code> against <code>cluster</code> (we should get similar results with <code>pop</code>).</p>


```{r}
# Load ggrepel
library(ggrepel)
# Add cluster column to argentina
argentina <- argentina %>% 
               mutate(cluster = clusters_as_factor)

# Make a scatterplot of gdp vs. cluster, colored by cluster
ggplot(argentina, aes(cluster, gdp, col = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = cluster), show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Cluster", y = "GDP")

```


  ## 10. The rich provinces
<p>Provinces in cluster 2 have large negative values in Dimension 1. The biplot shows that <code>gdp_per_cap</code>, <code>movie_theaters_per_cap</code> and <code>doctors_per_cap</code> also have high negative values in Dimension 1. </p>
<p><img width="700px" height="700px" src="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_638/img/biplot.png"></p>
<p>If we plot <code>gdp_per_cap</code> for each cluster, we can see that provinces in this cluster 2, in general, have greater GDP per capita than the provinces in the other clusters. San Luis is the only province from the other clusters with <code>gdp_per_cap</code> in the range of values observed in cluster 2. We will see similar results for <code>movie_theaters_per_cap</code> and <code>doctors_per_cap</code>.</p>


```{r}
# Make a scatterplot of GDP per capita vs. cluster, colored by cluster
ggplot(argentina, aes(cluster, gdp_per_cap, col = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = cluster), show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Cluster", y = "GDP per capita")
```



## 11. The poor provinces
<p>Provinces in Cluster 3 have high positive values in Dimension 1. As shown in the biplot, provinces with high positive values in Dimension 1 have high values in poverty, deficient infrastructure, etc. These variables are also negatively correlated with <code>gdp_per_cap</code>, so these provinces have low values in this variable.</p>
<p><img width="700px" height="700px" src="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_638/img/biplot.png"></p>


```{r}
# Make scatterplot of poverty vs. cluster, colored by cluster
ggplot(argentina, aes(cluster, poverty , col = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = cluster), show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Cluster", y = "Poverty rate")
```


```{r}
student_plot <- last_plot()

soln_plot <- ggplot(soln_argentina, aes(cluster, poverty, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=province), show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x="Cluster", y="Poverty rate")


run_tests({
    
      
    test_that("The plot is correct", {

      )
    })

    test_that("last plot has geom_point and geom_text_repel layers", {
        
      student_plot_layers <- student_plot$layers
      student_plot_layers_geoms <- map(student_plot_layers, ~class(.$geom)[[1]])

      expect_true("GeomPoint" %in% student_plot_layers_geoms,

    })
    
})
```

## 12. Planning for public policy
<p>Now that we have an idea of how social and economic welfare varies among provinces, we've been asked to help plan an education program. A pilot phase of the program will be carried out to identify design issues. Our goal is to select the proposal with the most diverse set of provinces:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tucumán, San Juán, and Entre Ríos</li>
<li>Córdoba, Santa Fé, and Mendoza</li>
<li>Buenos Aires, Santa Cruz, and Misiones </li>
</ol>
<p>Which proposal includes the most diverse set of provinces?</p>
<p><img width="800px" height="800px" src="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_638/img/components_color.png"></p>


```{r}
# Assign pilot provinces to the most diverse group
pilot_provinces <- ....
```


```{r}
run_tests({
    test_that("the answer is 1, 2 or 3", {
      expect_true(as.numeric(pilot_provinces) %in% c(1, 2, 3), 
        info = "You should choose one of groups 1, 2 or 3")
    })
    test_that("the answer is not 1", {
      expect_false(as.numeric(pilot_provinces) %in% c(1, 2), 
        info = "This set of provinces is on the same cluster, and are very similar")
    })
})
```
